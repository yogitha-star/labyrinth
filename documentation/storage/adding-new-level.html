<h1>Adding and Switching Levels</h1>

<p>
This document explains how to add a new level in Labyrinth
and how to switch between different levels during the game.
</p>

<h2>Understanding Levels</h2>
<p>
Levels in Labyrinth are defined inside <code>/js/levels.js</code>.
Each level is created using the <code>new Level("LevelName", [...])</code> constructor,
where the second argument is a two-dimensional array representing the layout of tiles.
</p>

<p>
Each row in the array represents a row of tiles in the level.
Each element inside the row refers to a specific tile definition
(such as <code>door.goal</code>, <code>forest.top</code>, etc.).
</p>

<h2>Adding a New Level</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Open <code>/js/levels.js</code>.</li>
  <li>Locate an existing level function such as <code>createFirstLevel()</code> or <code>createAdvancedLevel()</code>.</li>
  <li>Copy an existing level function and rename it (for example, <code>createMyNewLevel()</code>).</li>
  <li>Modify the 2D tile array to design your new level layout.</li>
  <li>Ensure that a starting tile is defined using <code>PlayerStartsAt(theme.start)</code> or a similar start tile.</li>
  <li>Save the file after making changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Switching Between Levels</h2>
<p>
To switch between levels, update the level creation reference used when initializing the game.
Levels are loaded through functions defined in <code>/js/levels.js</code>.
</p>

<p>
For example, if the game currently uses:
</p>

<pre>
createFirstLevel()
</pre>

<p>
You can switch to another level by replacing it with:
</p>

<pre>
createAdvancedLevel()
</pre>

<p>
This change is typically done in the game initialization logic
(for example, inside <code>/js/gui.js</code>).
The selected level function determines which tile configuration
is loaded when the game starts.
</p>

<h2>Adding a Goal Tile</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Goal tiles are defined inside <code>/js/levels.js</code> as part of the level’s 2D array.</li>
  <li>Depending on the theme, a goal tile may appear as <code>door.goal</code>, <code>food.end</code>, <code>dark.end</code>, or similar.</li>
  <li>Place the goal tile at the desired position inside the level array.</li>
  <li>The level is considered complete when the player reaches the goal tile.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The engine does not strictly enforce having exactly one goal tile.
If multiple goal tiles are added, all of them will be placed in the level.
If no goal tile is defined, the level may not complete as expected.
Therefore, it is recommended to include exactly one goal tile per level.
</p>
