<h1>Adding and Switching Levels</h1>

<p>
This document explains how to add a new level in Labyrinth
and how to switch between different levels during the game.
</p>

<h2>Understanding Levels</h2>
<p>
A level in Labyrinth defines the layout of tiles, paths, and the goal.
Each level is created using existing tile definitions and configurations.
Before adding a new level, it is recommended to review an existing level
to understand the structure.
</p>

<h2>Adding a New Level</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Locate an existing level configuration in the project.</li>
  <li>Copy an existing level to use it as a template.</li>
  <li>Modify the layout and tiles according to the new level design.</li>
  <li>Save the new level configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Switching Between Levels</h2>
<p>
To switch between levels, update the level reference used when the game
is initialized. The game loads the selected level configuration
when it starts or when a level change is triggered.
</p>

<h2>Adding a Goal Tile</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Locate an existing goal tile definition in the project.</li>
  <li>Ensure that only one goal tile is placed in a level.</li>
  <li>Position the goal tile at the desired target location.</li>
  <li>The level is completed when the player reaches the goal tile.</li>
</ul>
